Hello Fellow Humanoids!

JohhnyB here.
Finally joining the GitHub community after many years of working and hearing about it.

Professionally, I work in Finance/Accounting/IT doing what I can to help companies succeed. 
Not a complete coding newb but have a lot to learn (hmmm is that why I'm here...)

Happy to collaborate and share anything of value I may know. 

15+ years accounting/finance/management experience with a passion for the tech side - dbs, dwhs, spreadsheets, analytics, sql.
